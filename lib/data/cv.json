  "description": "I am a passionate third-year student studying software engineering who is driven to create engaging user interfaces using code. I have a strong skill set from my web development adventure, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and a little bit of Redux for state management. While I'm getting my degree, I really enjoy learning new things and getting to know how to code. I regularly look for ways to put my talents to use outside of the classroom, whether it is through side projects or working with poop. Even though front-end programming is my primary area of interest, I'm eager to use React Native to create mobile apps.",
